</div>


<p class="nind">
<span class="dropcap">T</span>HE founder of this Lecture has chosen as one of his special interests
the history of Mathematics, both through the ages and as reflected in
the studies of the University. Within a short compass he has given
an account of the development of the subject which contrasts with
the elaborate treatises of previous writers by its concentration
on essentials, and also by the glimpses which it affords of the
personalities of the mathematicians whose achievements he records, with
their limitations and their failures, as well as their ambitions and
successes.</p>

<p>The study of the successive steps in the evolution of any subject is
an attractive pursuit, and many years ago, speaking not far from this
place, I was led to hazard some speculations as to the ideas which
prompted and guided the very first steps in the development of Greek
Mathematics. I even ventured to say, not altogether in the spirit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
paradox, that if any one scientific invention could claim pre-eminence
above all others, I should be inclined to suggest a monument to the
unknown inventor of the mathematical <i>point</i>, as the first
step in that long process of abstraction and idealization which has
culminated in the science (and not merely mathematical science) of
to-day. I remember that the eminent engineer who sat near remarked to
me afterwards that if the scale of subscriptions was to be appropriate
to the dimensions of the object to be commemorated he would gladly
head the list. An even more eminent astronomer told me that the whole
address was an elaborate scientific joke. Such friendly satire did not
disturb my opinion; but speculations on the psychology of the primitive
mathematicians, attractive as I think they are, are necessarily
precarious, and I am not tempted to venture on this field again. The
task which I would attempt to-day is to trace the leading steps in
the development of that great tradition of Mathematical Physics, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
distinguished from Dynamics and Astronomy, which began in the early
years of the last century, and has dominated physical speculation until
quite recent times, when new discoveries and new ideas have emerged,
calling for newer methods, without, however, rendering the old ones
obsolete. The ground has of course been traversed before, but not I
think quite from the present point of view. I am not concerned with
physical theories as such but rather with the mathematical dress which
they have assumed from time to time. My object is to shew how it comes
about that we have inherited a mathematical scheme which in its final
form embraces subjects physically so different as Heat-Conduction,
Hydrodynamics, Elasticity, Magnetism, Electricity, and Light, and can
be made to include any one of these by assigning proper names to the
symbols. The scheme admits of course of being set forth in a purely
abstract form without any physical reference at all, and this has in
fact been done; but its chief value is for the physical analogies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
which it facilitates, and in which it originated. The development has
been continuous, although the wide scope of the final result could not
have been foreseen.</p>

<p>The time I have indicated as a starting point was peculiarly
favourable. The great calculator Euler had ranged over the whole field
of Mathematics, and had given to many parts of it almost the final form
which we find in our text-books. Lagrange, Laplace, and Legendre had
developed the Newtonian Astronomy, and made important contributions to
general Dynamics, as well as incidentally to Analysis. So that when
attention began to be directed to physical subjects the available
mathematical resources were far in advance of what had been within
reach at any earlier period.</p>

<p>Isolated questions of course had been treated previously; for instance
the flexure of bars had been discussed by Bernoulli and Euler.
More important from the present point of view is the foundation of
Hydrodynamics by Euler, who formulated the fundamental differential
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
equations, and proceeded to integrate them on the supposition that a
velocity-potential exists. He was careful to note, however, that there
are cases, such as that of uniform rotation about an axis, where this
condition is not fulfilled. The theory of plane waves of sound was also
known, and I need hardly recall the subject of vibrating strings with
its reactions on Analysis, and the long controversies which resulted.
But the starting point of Mathematical Physics, in the now general
sense of the term, is to be fixed I think about the time when the
storms of the French revolution had subsided and were succeeded by the
comparative tranquillity of the early Empire. If a more definite date
is required, we may perhaps fix on the year 1807, which was marked by
the publication of Poisson’s first memoir on Sound. This deals with
spherical waves, with waves in an atmosphere of variable density and,
most astonishing of all, with waves of finite amplitude. He finds that
the boundaries of such a wave advance with the ordinary velocity of
sound, but omits to examine the progressive change of type. This was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
only done long afterwards by Stokes. It may I think be said of Poisson
that, with all his extraordinary power in dealing with a problem
when once it had been reduced to an analytical form, and the great
achievements which stand to his credit, he was less concerned with the
physical interpretation of his results.</p>

<p>The same year, 1807, is still more memorable for the first instalment
of Fourier’s investigations on the Conduction of Heat, whose importance
extends far beyond the special subject. Mathematicians so eminent as
Hamilton, Maxwell, and Kelvin have found it difficult to speak of
Fourier in measured terms of appreciation, whether of the ingenuity
of his mathematical processes, the elegance of his results, or of
his broad and philosophical outlook, as revealed especially in the
preface to his formal treatise. Fourier had indeed the advantage of a
rather varied career. He was trained at first for the priesthood, then
rejected for the (royalist) artillery school, with the remark in so
many words that the lowliness of his origin would have disqualified
him “even if he had been a second Newton.” He became a pupil at the
École Normale, and later professor at the École Polytechnique. He
was included in Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt, as a Member of the
ambitious Egyptian Institute which it was proposed to found, and of
which Monge was President. Returning to France in 1802 he was made
prefect of the Department of the Isère, possibly on account of the
administrative talent which he is said to have displayed in Egypt,
and it was at Grenoble that he began the composition of his classical
work. His subsequent history, though interesting and honourable, hardly
concerns us, but the facts I have mentioned suggest that his varied and
responsible experience, as well as the literary studies which were an
obligatory part of his early education, and in which he is said to have
excelled, was not without influence on his work, or on the luminous
style in which it is explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>At the very outset of his book we meet for the first time with a
process which now seems so obvious and familiar that the mention of it
may appear trivial. I mean the device by which the rate of change of
a physical property at any point of a medium is calculated in terms
of its flux into an element of volume. But it could hardly have been
quite obvious, for many years elapsed before so simple a matter as
the equation of continuity in Hydrodynamics was proved in this way by
William Thomson, who also pointed out its utility in the expression of
Laplace’s equation <img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 8.369ex; height: 2.351ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nabla^{2} \phi = 0"> in curvilinear co-ordinates.
At a later period the process received a brilliant extension at the
hands of Maxwell, in his theory of gases, where it was applied to the
flux of momentum and also of energy.</p>

<p>The mathematical methods employed by Fourier in his treatment of
special problems repay a careful study. As they stand they would often
fail to satisfy even a lenient standard of mathematical rigour, and
indeed they appear to have raised doubts in the minds of Laplace,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Lagrange, and Legendre, who formed the distinguished commission charged
to examine one of his memoirs. But they are models of what may be
called mathematical experiment; and at any rate they are successful in
the end, and the results are easily verified. The form, again, in which
these results are presented is I think quite unlike anything that had
gone before, especially in the occurrence of definite integrals, but a
slight examination shews that it would be difficult to imagine anything
more adapted to the particular circumstances, or really more lucid. One
special question examined by Fourier may be noticed for its connection
with more recent speculations. It had been debated whether the earth
has an intrinsic store of heat, or whether it was altogether dependent
on the sun. Fourier’s conclusion is that the internal temperatures
are independent of the solar influence, but that the latter is
mainly responsible for the superficial temperatures. Among Fourier’s
anticipations of modern practice, we may cite his recourse to graphical
methods for the solution of equations, and especially his insistence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
on the necessity that results should be capable of reduction, when
needed, to numerical form.</p>

<p>The general equations of Hydrodynamics date from Euler (1755), but a
long period elapsed before any but the simplest applications were made
of them. The theory of waves on water was propounded by the French
Academy as the subject of a prize essay for the year 1815. The problem
proposed was to trace the effect of a given initial disturbance of
the surface. The memoir of Cauchy, to whom the prize was awarded,
is remarkable as containing the first satisfactory proof of the
persistence of the irrotational quality in a portion of fluid which
possesses it at any one instant. The analytical difficulties of the
special problem are considerable, owing mainly to the fact that there
is no definite wave-velocity, but the genius of the author supplied
what was wanting, and the notes afterwards appended to his memoir
contain a store of important analytical results, relating chiefly to
definite integrals. In particular we meet here for the first time with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the integrals known afterwards by the name of Fresnel, who encountered
them in his work on Physical Optics. A parallel and independent
memoir by Poisson, who was himself debarred from competing for the
prize, confines itself more closely to the terms of the problem, but
agrees in the main results. It is remarkable that neither writer
pauses to consider the simpler and more fundamental properties of a
simple-harmonic train of waves. This was left for Green and Airy,
and extended in various ways by Stokes. It should not be overlooked
that the work of both Cauchy and Poisson was only rendered possible
by Fourier’s analysis of an arbitrary function into simple-harmonic
components. Not long afterwards Poisson took up the problem of the
sound waves in an unlimited medium due to arbitrary initial conditions.
The result is given in what Airy (I think) called the unsatisfactory
form of a definite integral. The interpretation was not dwelt upon
by Poisson, but here again had to wait for the penetrating genius of
Stokes. It is then recognized that Poisson’s formula, far from being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
unsatisfactory, gives precisely what one would wish to know, in the
most convenient and appropriate form.</p>

<p>From this period onwards the flow of production was so rapid, and
embraced so many subjects, that it is rather difficult to review it in
any orderly sequence. One very important matter is the growth of the
theory of Elasticity. The interest in this subject had been revived
by the experiments of Chladni on vibrating plates, which formed a
feature of the lectures on Acoustics which he gave in various places,
as they have of most courses on the subject ever since. A skilled
experimenter, and endowed with a fine musical ear, he was able not
only to evoke a vast number of figures of nodal lines, formed by sand
strewn on the plates, but also to assign their relative pitch, and even
to formulate approximate numerical relations. His lectures were very
successful, and appear to have excited the interest of the fashionable
world, much as a lecture on soap-bubbles might at the present day.
His visit to Paris was the occasion, at Napoleon’s suggestion, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the theory of the figures now known by his name was proposed by the
Academy as the subject of a prize essay for the year 1811. Among the
competitors was one of the slender array of women who have figured in
the history of Mathematics, Mdlle Sophie Germain. This lady had found
inspiration in the pages of Montucla, and had devoted herself with
great enthusiasm to the study of Mathematics, to the grievous distress
of her parents. Lagrange, strange to say, had warned her that the
problem was hopeless, and indeed her attempts were not very successful,
even though she gained the prize at a subsequent competition. Like
other of the earlier writers on the question, she assumed, on the
analogy of Euler’s problem of the bar, that the energy of deformation
of a plate is a quadratic function of the principal curvatures. This
is sufficiently correct, but the choice of the particular function was
unfortunate. The further history of the problem is very interesting
mathematically, but would lead us too far. The question could not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
be satisfactorily treated until the general theory of Elasticity
had been further developed, and the relations between stresses and
strains established. An additional impulse to the subject came from
the wave-theory of Light which was growing rapidly at the hands of
Young and Fresnel. The first essays at a general theory of elastic
solids were made by Navier, Poisson, and Cauchy. Their investigations
are noteworthy as including the first systematic attempts to deduce
the properties of a body from the explicit hypothesis of a molecular
structure. The word “molecule” it is true occurs over and over again
in previous mathematical literature, but its meaning is usually that
which we attach to the word “particle,” viz. a small portion of a
substance really treated as continuous. Laplace, again, had given a
theory of capillarity based on the conception of forces having a very
minute range of action, but the substance is treated as continuous, and
the work was really a development of the theory of Attractions, with a
generalized law of force. In the memoirs of Navier and Poisson, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
a large extent in those of Cauchy, an elastic solid is conceived as a
static arrangement of discrete molecules separated by finite intervals.
The molecules are treated as mathematical points, and the mutual
forces are supposed to be functions of the distance only, independent
of direction. The range of the forces, though small, is assumed to be
large compared with the intra-molecular spaces. All this is of course
a possible conception, and a suitable matter for mathematical study,
whether it corresponds to reality or not. One further assumption
was, however, made, which has been much questioned, viz. that the
displacements of consecutive molecules, when the body is deformed, are
continuous functions of the co-ordinates. As applying to isotropic
bodies in which the configuration of molecules about any point is
assumed to be quite irregular, this can hardly be defended, but there
is more to be said for it in the case of a crystalline structure. The
continuity which is assumed in modern theories of Elasticity relates
of course to averages, and not to individual molecules. Without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
further examination of the molecular assumptions, some of which are
unnecessarily restricted, whilst the reasoning is sometimes difficult
to follow, we may note that Navier and Poisson were led, in the case of
isotropy, to equations which coincide with those generally accepted,
except in one particular. The inference that there is an invariable
ratio between the volume-elasticity and the rigidity of a substance
was long a matter of controversy, but has not survived the criticism
of Stokes and the experiments of Kirchhoff. Having obtained his
equations, Poisson proceeds to apply them to various special problems,
such as the radial vibrations of a sphere, the lateral vibrations of
bars, and the symmetrical vibrations of circular plates. The latter
especially is a skilful piece of analysis, involving Bessel Functions
of both real and imaginary arguments, and is pushed to numerical
results. The paper was soon followed by another, dealing with the
problem of plane elastic waves in an isotropic solid. The two types
characterized by longitudinal and transverse vibrations, respectively,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
are distinguished, and the corresponding wave-velocities found.</p>

<p>A great improvement in the theory was made by Cauchy, who initiated
the modern theory of stress and strain. As an alternative to the
method which he had first adopted, he abandons all explicit mention
of molecules, and treats a solid as practically continuous. Extending
the notion of pressure which was current in Hydrostatics, he assumes
that the force between any two adjacent parts of a substance can be
regarded as made up of actions between two strata of excessively
small depth on the two sides of the interface, and may accordingly
be treated as a surface-force or “stress.” He goes on to investigate
the relation between the stresses across different planes, and to
express them geometrically by means of the stress-ellipsoid. This use
of an ellipsoid to represent the relations between various directional
properties in Mechanics is I believe original with Cauchy, who applied
it also in the theory of strains, as well as in the more familiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
matter of moments of inertia. His equations for an isotropic substance,
obtained by this second method, are based on the hypothesis that the
principal axes of stress and strain coincide, and have the now usual
form, with two independent elastic constants. The whole procedure is
in fact that found in modern books. It should be mentioned also that
Cauchy in his work on strains introduces for the first time the notion
of the infinitesimal rotation of an element, afterwards utilized by
Stokes and Helmholtz.</p>

<p>Cauchy next took up the theory of crystalline solids, this time
naturally on the basis of an assumed orderly arrangement of molecules,
but his results have failed to stand the test of experiment, or to
furnish a satisfactory explanation of double-refraction. The true
theory of elastic solids in the general case, free from all molecular
hypothesis, was given later by Green, whose work is the first example
of the application of energy-methods to the physics of continua,
the analytical process being an adaptation of the variational
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
method of Lagrange. It is fortunately not my task to discuss these
things from the point of view of Physical Optics, or to review the
long-continued and obstinate attempts of successive physicists to
construct a mechanical model of the ether, now definitely abandoned.
At the present time the real outlet for the theory of elastic waves
and their reflection and refraction is in relation to Seismology,
where it has led to important results. The chief interest of the
theory of Elasticity to us at the moment consists partly in the
gradual emancipation from molecular assumptions, and partly in that
the analytical relations which it involved were destined to find
a wider and more important sphere of application. To take a very
simple instance, in the equations of equilibrium of an incompressible
isotropic solid,
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -4.73ex; width: 26.199ex; height: 10.59ex;" src="images/1.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} +  \mu \nabla^{2} u = 0,\, \text{&c.},\, \text{&c.},\\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial x}{\partial x}=0,
\end{aligned}
"></span>
the symbols are such as present themselves in very different fields,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and it is to be remembered that it was from this very example that
Thomson, in his early speculations, constructed analogies between
elastic displacements and rotations on the one hand, and distributions
of electric and magnetic force in free space on the other.</p>

<p>To observe the growth of mathematical Electricity we must go back to
the year 1811, when Poisson laid the foundations of Electrostatics
as a branch of the theory of Attractions. Adopting the hypothesis of
two electric fluids, he remarks that the resultant electric force at
any point in the interior of a conductor must be zero. Combined with
Coulomb’s law of electric force, and Laplace’s relation between normal
force and surface density, this led at once to the distribution of
electricity on a charged conductor in the form of an ellipsoid. Poisson
further introduces the conception (but not the name) of the electric
potential, and lays down the conditions which it has to satisfy at
any point of the field due to a system of electrified conductors. In
particular he investigates the induced distribution on a sphere due
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
to any system of external charges. Finally, by a triumph of analytical
skill, he solved the classical problem of two electrified spheres.</p>

<p>From the present point of view there is little further to record
till Oersted’s discovery of the action of an electric current on
a magnetic needle (1820). This was followed almost immediately by
Savart’s analysis of the magnetic force into forces due to the
infinitesimal elements of the electric circuit, and the simple rule
which he formulated. This led Ampère to study the mechanical action
between electric circuits. He analysed this into forces between the
elements of the circuits, acting in the lines joining them, and
subject to the law of action and re-action. His theory was based on a
few plausible assumptions, and on a series of experiments devised in
a strictly mathematical spirit to narrow down the various issues to
be decided. His work is now seldom referred to, but it exhibits the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
mathematical skill which he had exercised before in the Calculus of
Variations, as well as in other directions. It is true that we are
still in the atmosphere of action at a distance, and Ampère appeals in
fact to the example of Newton and Gravitation, but only with Newton’s
qualification. He does not claim to have arrived at an ultimate
explanation of phenomena, but only to have established a formula from
which these can be calculated. The consequences which he deduced are
more significant than the formula of elementary attraction itself.
In the first place he finds that the resultant effect of a closed
circuit on an element of another circuit depends on a vector which is
afterwards identified with magnetic force. He then finds the force
exerted on a small closed circuit, and proves it to be identical with
the force on an elementary magnet. The familiar representation of a
current by a magnetic shell follows, as well as the theory that the
properties of a magnetized body are due to currents circulating in the
molecules. Two provinces of physics, hitherto distinct, were here for
the first time co-ordinated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The views of Ampère, owing to their novelty, naturally excited at first
some distrust. Preconceptions, especially when they have a definite
form, die hard; and it is to be remarked that Poisson’s great memoir on
Magnetism, in which the hypothesis of two magnetic fluids is supposed
to be verified, coincides almost in time with the latest publication of
Ampère.</p>

<p>A good deal of Poisson’s work on Magnetism has become classical, in
the sense that subsequent writers have found nothing better than to
reproduce it. It is largely independent of the two-fluid theory, and
is really a theory of magnetic elements, afterwards treated explicitly
as such, without further hypothesis, in the extensions given later by
Thomson. The transformation by which the potential of a continuous
arrangement of magnetic elements is expressed as due to distribution
of imaginary magnetic matter through the volume and over the surface
now appears for the first time. In his treatment of magnetic induction
Poisson imagines his two fluids to be free to move within molecular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
spaces which for definiteness he treats as spherical. This latter
assumption may be taken as merely illustrative, although it leads
to a definite and sometimes impossible value of a coefficient. The
particular problems solved, viz. the magnetization of a spherical
shell, and of an ellipsoid, by a uniform field retain an interest
independent of this special hypothesis.</p>

<p>The years which immediately followed were marked chiefly by the
researches of Navier, Cauchy, and Poisson on Elasticity which have
already been noticed. We come next to Green’s Essay on Electricity and
Magnetism (1828). The mathematical theory of Electrostatics, which had
been initiated by Poisson, is here resumed and in a sense completed.
The treatment is based on the theorem now generally quoted by the
author’s name. The novel point here is not the transformation from
volume- to surface-integrals, for this was to be found in Poisson, but
that it is the first example of the reciprocal relations which pervade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
not only Dynamics, but all branches of Physics. In the present case it
is a relation between two different distributions of Electricity, but
it only needs to give suitable meanings to the symbols to translate it
into the language of Hydrodynamics or Acoustics. From the mathematical
standpoint we have, further, the treatment of singularities of
harmonic functions. The electrostatic theorems due to Green are
reproduced in most modern text-books. Among original results we may
notice the screening effect of conducting surfaces, the distribution
of electricity on a spherical conductor due to internal or external
charges, and the theory of condensers.</p>

<p>The phenomena of mutual induction and self-induction of electric
currents were discovered by Faraday in 1831-35, but a long period
elapsed before these received explicit mathematical investigation, and
a longer still before it was recognized that Faraday’s own description
in terms of lines of force could be put in an exact mathematical form.
The work of F. Neumann (1845-47) was the complement of that of Ampère
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and involved the same kind of ideas. The additional experimental fact
adduced was Lenz’s law. When there is relative motion of two circuits,
or of a circuit and a magnet, currents are induced and there are
consequent mechanical forces, which can be calculated from the formulae
of Ampère. The law referred to is that the sense of the induced
currents is such that these mechanical forces act in opposition to the
relative motion. Neumann assumes this to be true also as regards the
infinitesimal elements into which the circuits may be resolved, and
further that the electro-motive force of induction is proportional to
the velocity of the relative motion, to the strength of the inducing
current or magnet, and to the component (with sign reversed) of the
mechanical force in the direction of the relative motion. For the two
former of these assumptions there was the experimental evidence of
Faraday and others, the latter was adopted as the simplest supposition
consistent with the law of Lenz. From this basis he proves that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
total current induced in a circuit by the motion of a magnetic pole is
proportional to the change in the potential of the pole in relation
to a unit current in the circuit, and again to the change in the flux
of magnetic force through the circuit. This is really Faraday’s rule,
except that it is not expressed in so many words in terms of lines of
force. In the second paper he shews that the mechanical action between
two currents depends on the mutual potential of the two circuits, viz.
<span class="align-center"><img style="vertical-align: -1.948ex; width: 15.513ex; height: 5.195ex;" src="images/2.svg" alt=" " data-tex="
\iint \frac{\cos\epsilon\, ds\, ds'}{r},
"></span>
and refers the electro-motive forces of induction to changes in the
value of this function.</p>

<p>We are still in the atmosphere of action at a distance, and it was
therefore not unnatural that Weber and others should have looked for
an explanation both of the mechanical and the inductive effects in a
modification of Coulomb’s law of force between electric charges. Since
the actions to be explained depend on rates of change, violence had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
be done to previous notions, and terms depending on mutual velocities
and accelerations were introduced. The resulting law of Weber, which
happened to be so framed as not to conflict with the conservation of
energy, long exercised a fascination on continental writers, owing
to the mathematical neatness of the processes by which the results
of Ampère and Neumann could be deduced from it. It was not finally
abandoned until Helmholtz shewed that under certain conditions it
implied unstable electrical equilibrium, as well as other paradoxical
consequences.</p>

<p>The year (1846) in which Weber’s law of electric force was promulgated
marks also very approximately the beginning of the modern tendency
to ignore action at a distance, and to bring the medium across which
electric and magnetic actions take place into the reckoning. The
elastic analogies of Thomson have been mentioned already. Another
analogy, between Electrostatics and Heat-Conduction, had been noted
by him a little earlier, and used to illustrate various propositions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
in Attractions. The mathematical theory of Magnetism, next taken up
by Thomson, was set forth in a form free from all hypothesis, the
magnetic fluids of Poisson and others being now replaced by the notion
of magnetic polarization. He further added to the grammar of continua
by developing the conceptions and the properties of solenoidal and
lamellar distributions of magnetism, which were suggested by Ampère’s
investigations. The two definitions of magnetic force in the interior
of a magnet, afterwards distinguished as magnetic force and magnetic
induction, are also introduced here for the first time. The whole
memoir is a model of scientific exposition, and recalls the ‘grand
style’ of the classical mathematicians, and especially of Gauss.</p>

<p>A final step towards a complete formulation on modern lines of the
mathematical relations of Electricity consisted in the expression
of magnetic force, or rather magnetic induction, in terms of the
vector now known by the name of electric momentum. This vector,
or its analogues, presented itself in various ways. We have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
first an investigation by Kirchhoff on the laws of induction in
three-dimensional conductors, based on Weber’s law of electric force.
Almost simultaneously we have Stokes’s paper on the Dynamical Theory
of Diffraction, which is not so important nowadays as a contribution
to Optics, but as containing a calculation of the waves in an elastic
medium due to any initial disturbance. This was made to depend on
Poisson’s integration of the general equation of sound, and it is
here that we meet for the first time with a full interpretation of
this solution, which led up to that of the elastic wave-problem. The
relation to the present matter consists, however, in the kinematical
process by which displacements in any medium are expressed in terms of
expansions and rotations, so that in Clifford’s language everything is
reduced to “squirts and whirls.” The same process occurs again some
years later in Helmholtz’s great memoir on Vortex Motion, where we meet
explicitly with the analogy of the relations between electric currents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and magnetic force to those between vortices and fluid velocities. This
analogy is developed towards the close of the investigation, but we can
now see that it was implicit from the beginning in the very definition
of a vortex. In both investigations the connection is established by
means of a subsidiary vector, which in the electric analogy corresponds
to the electric momentum of Maxwell.</p>

<p>The paper by Maxwell “On Faraday’s Lines of Force,” written shortly
after he had taken his degree, is now perhaps little read, but
deserves attention if only for the introduction, written in his own
incomparable style, where we find already laid down the lines on which
his subsequent speculations were to proceed. From the mathematical
standpoint the paper is a comprehensive statement, without a
suggestion of theory, describing the known facts of Electro-magnetism
in terms of a system of vectors supposed to exist at all points of
the field. Precision is here given to Faraday’s idea of lines of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
force, whether electric or magnetic, by means of the analogy of the
motion of an incompressible fluid. The new vector here introduced
into Electro-magnetism is that of momentum, and its rate of change is
shewn by a dynamical, argument to be responsible for electro-magnetic
induction. The proof of this depends on the expression for the energy
of the field in terms of an integral extending over space, and is a
deduction from the conservation of energy. The dynamical relation
between pondero-motive and inductive forces had been indicated in a
general way by Helmholtz in his celebrated tract, and this may possibly
have been the first suggestion to Maxwell’s subsequent dynamical theory.</p>

<p>The way was in fact now clear, so far as the mathematical scheme is
concerned, for Maxwell’s definite theory. He ventured as we all know
to go a step further and to look behind the mathematical relations for
a deeper insight into the matter, and if possible for a physical or
mechanical meaning of the analytical symbols. Regarding the question
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
as a dynamical one he sketched out a mechanical model of the ether
which should reproduce the known electrical relations, rather with a
view of convincing himself that such a model was possible than as a
definite explanation in detail. This was followed by the classical
paper in which the laws of electro-magnetism were shewn to be deducible
from dynamical considerations, without the assumption of any particular
mechanism. The final presentment in his treatise, in which use is
made of Lagrange’s generalized equations, is too familiar to need
further reference. Whether we prefer to regard it as an analogy or an
explanation, it is a striking exemplification of the originality of
Maxwell’s genius.</p>

<p>At this point we may appropriately close our survey, for I do not
undertake to be a guide in the subsequent history, which is still in
the making. It is, however, to be remarked that Maxwell, who placed as
it were the crown on one period of Mathematical Physics, was also in
a sense the initiator of another, by his work on Gas Theory, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
involved the creation of a molecular calculus.</p>

<p>Looking back on this long history we can trace through all the details
an increasing tendency. The period we have been reviewing began under
the influence of the great achievements of Laplace and Lagrange in
the development of the Newtonian Astronomy. The notion of action at a
distance, though not regarded by Newton himself as the last word on
the matter, had had a great success, and when the field of Physical
Astronomy was beginning to be fully occupied, the mathematicians who
turned their attention to physical questions very naturally assumed
that the same conception would be fruitful in other directions.
Fortunately there was one physical process where these ideas obviously
did not apply. Heat was indeed imagined to be a material, and moreover
a fluid substance, but hardly molecular, and its transmission in
conductors was naturally regarded as a continuous process. To this we
owe the work of Fourier, which stands by itself, outside the historical
order of development, except in so far as the solution of particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
problems involved analytical processes, and led to analytical theorems
which had a much wider scope. When the molecular structure of bodies
was taken into account, as in the early days of Elasticity, the steps
were somewhat vague and uncertain, and I think that the writers
themselves must have experienced some relief when they had finally
arrived at their differential equations, and felt really at home. It
was a great improvement when the consideration of molecular forces
could be dispensed with and replaced by Cauchy’s theory of stress. The
same tendency to discard unnecessary and unverifiable hypothesis has
been exemplified in Electricity, in the transition from Poisson and
Ampère to Thomson and Maxwell.</p>

<p>One feature which is met with in our period is the frank appeal to
intuition. This is noticeable already in the case of Fourier, as
has been already indicated, but it runs through the whole school.
Even Cauchy, who was or became something of a purist according to
the standards of his day, did not shrink on occasion from handling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
divergent integrals, but managed always to come right in the end.
There is this to be said about mathematical work, in any but quite
incompetent hands, that a too careless induction sooner or later
betrays itself, and leads to a revision of the whole calculation.
The great mathematicians, whatever licence they may have allowed
themselves, have always had a sure instinct to save them from logical
disaster. The <i>rôle</i> which intuition plays in mathematical
discovery has sometimes been slighted or even denied. But was it not
Gauss who, questioned as to the progress of a research on which he was
engaged, replied that he had arrived at the theorems, and that it only
remained to find the proofs? For such things as existence-theorems
we must of course not look, at all events in the earlier half of our
period. The first instance of the consciousness of such a requirement
that I can call to mind occurs in Green, but he at once proceeds to
appeal to physical conceptions. He wished to satisfy himself as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the existence of a function satisfying Laplace’s equation, which
should vanish over a closed surface, and have a definite singularity
at a given internal point. He regards it as sufficient to remark
that this is the case of an uninsulated conducting surface under the
influence of an internal charge. The same use of physical proofs is to
be found in Maxwell, and in an especial degree in the writing of the
late Lord Rayleigh. The physical mathematician may reasonably claim
a certain licence in this respect. He is often in the case of Gauss;
the proposition is certain, but having his own business to attend to,
he leaves the rigorous proof to the analyst, who ought indeed to be
very grateful to him for the exquisite logical exercise which he has
provided.</p>

<p>A further feature in the evolution is the gradual recognition of
geometrical or physical meanings in various symbols or groups
of symbols which are of constant recurrence. This is specially
characteristic of the later stages. To Laplace and his school the
potential was simply a convenient mathematical entity; the name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
with its associations came long afterwards from Green. The equation
<img style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 8.369ex; height: 2.351ex;" src="images/3.svg" alt=" " data-tex="\nabla^{2} \phi = 0"> lost most of its significance when it was
transformed, as was necessary for some purposes, to polar co-ordinates,
and the recognition of the general properties of the function was
delayed. The equation itself first received an explicit interpretation
at the hands of Maxwell, and the same holds with regard to the now
familiar conceptions of ‘divergence,’ ‘concentration,’ and so on.
And it needs hardly to be said that the notion of an operator, as
distinguished from the result, belongs to the later period. The
terminology of physical entities or qualities such as ‘isotropy,’
‘permeability,’ and so on is largely due to Kelvin, with his copious
onomastic faculty.</p>

<p>I have referred mainly to the development of general principles and
methods, but that is, of course, not the whole of the story. A complete
history would have to treat in some detail the special problems which
suggested themselves from time to time. The impulse to general theory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
indeed often came about in this way. For instance, the problem of the
two electrified spheres gave the impulse to Electrostatics, whilst
Chladni’s figures of nodal lines led up by degrees to the theory of
Elasticity. It is, moreover, in the special applications that the skill
of the analyst is particularly evoked, with results often of great
interest and value even from the purely mathematical point of view.
We need not go back to the theory of Attractions, or of the Figure of
the Earth, which evoked Spherical Harmonics. The Conduction of Heat
led incidentally to Bessel Functions, and above all to the theorems
specially associated with the name of Fourier, whilst Poisson’s
problem of the two electrified spheres is a signal instance of the
treatment of a functional equation. To Kelvin we owe the method of
electric inversion, including the astonishing solution of the problem
of the electrified spherical bowl, which had engaged the attention
of Green, and the symmetrical treatment of Spherical Harmonics. To
Maxwell are due the singularly beautiful solution of the problem of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
current sheets, a new interpretation of Spherical Harmonics, and other
interesting results and points of view scattered through his treatise.
As an example of a more systematic application of mathematical
technique we may refer again to Cauchy’s wave-problem, where the
integrals afterwards attributed to Fresnel first make their appearance.</p>

<p>I have tried in this rapid sketch to do justice especially to the
pioneers in the period; the merits and achievements of their more
recent successors are fresh in our memories. It was I think fortunate
that the first essays in the development of mathematical physics were
by men whose accomplishments ranged over the whole of mathematics,
and who thus had abundant analytical resources at their disposal. It
may be claimed indeed that they provided almost the entire analytical
equipment for their successors down to a comparatively recent time. You
may search for instance the volumes of Lord Kelvin’s papers and find
hardly an appeal to any result of Pure Mathematics later than Cauchy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
with the very important exception of what he had discovered himself.
The most important province of later analysis which has found a direct
application to physical questions is the Theory of Functions, and this
again, so far as is necessary for the purpose, dates back to Cauchy,
whom I should be disposed to place, after Fourier, as highest among the
pioneers of mathematical physics.</p>

<p>I should like to be able to tell more about these men, about their
characters, the vicissitudes of their lives and how these reacted on
their work, their ambitions, their friendships, and even their quarrels
and jealousies. Much that would be interesting is not to be found in
official obituary notices. Sometimes an indication of these more human
qualities has survived, such as the charming account of Ampère’s early
career, of the tragedy of his father’s death in the Revolution, and of
his idyllic love-story, and even the foible attributed to him in his
later years, of carrying off in all innocence the wrong umbrella, even
when there was no right one!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Some points of contrast with present conditions may be noted. The
scientific work was largely academical, not so much that the men held
as a rule official posts, or were trained in strict schools, but that
they were under the influence of scientific Academies, which jealously
guarded admission, and narrowly scrutinized the memoirs submitted to
them. Consequently there was a tendency towards what I have called
the ‘grand style,’ with great attention to form and presentation.
One result is that their memoirs can often even now be referred to
with interest, the absence of novelty in the subject matter being
compensated by the literary charm.</p>

<p>But the great and I think the enviable point of difference is that
there was little specialization, and no idea at all of a divorce
between Pure and Applied Mathematics. The names I have so often had
to quote testify how fruitful the alliance has been. And with all
recognition of modern difficulties, I would quote the words of Fourier,
but in a somewhat more catholic sense than he had in mind: “L’étude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
approfondie de la nature est la source la plus féconde des découvertes
mathématiques.”</p>

<p>The absence of English names from the first part of the record has
often been remarked upon and deplored. The whole story and its lessons
are given in Mr Rouse Ball’s well-known <i>History of Mathematics
at Cambridge</i>. We may point with pride however to the later
achievements of our countrymen, most of them more or less connected
with this University. Some features, specially characteristic, which we
may claim as of English origin have been already indicated, the search
for definite geometrical images of physical relations, and especially
the cultivation of graphical methods. I may in particular mention
the instructive diagrams which are appended to Maxwell’s treatise,
and which have been so great an assistance to the imagination of his
readers, and so valuable as an example to later writers.</p>

<p>The period we have been surveying had I think a fairly definite
beginning, and an almost equally definite close. From the mathematical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
point of view its most striking achievement is the wide-embracing
scheme of relations, which can be applied to so many diverse subjects,
with hardly more than a change in the names of the various concepts.
In their purely abstract form, in the rarefied atmosphere of Vector
Fields, Triple Tensors, and so on, these relations might almost be
developed in an hour, though they could hardly be understood or
appreciated without reference to their physical aspects, to which they
owe all their value. That such generality should have been attained
is an instance of the constant endeavour of Mathematics to reduce to
simple laws the infinite variety of nature. With a wider view than was
possible to Fourier, we may echo his Newtonian quotation: <i>Quod tam
paucis tam multa praestet geometria gloriatur</i>.</p>
